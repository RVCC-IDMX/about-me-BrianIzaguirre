 The purpose of this project was to get me to understand how each coding emelent works and understand their fuctions. The project showed that index.html is where you place the content and css is needed for fomrating/ creating a layout, adding color, alter fonts sizes and colors, photo sizing, etc... Creating a contact form is one of the best features added into the websites. If anyone has any questions, comment, or would want to contact me for any help, I would be able to reach out to them and reply back. Embeding a video was another cool feature to learn and adding a nav bar. Click on the tabs on the navbar and it will take you to that section of the page. for example, clicking on the contact tab will authomatically smoothly scroll down to the contact sections. Navbars is an easy way to get around the webiste. A very useful piece is using the @media tag where the website will adjust to any of the users screen. I learned how to put things in ordered list and bullet order and sub headers as sections. Also styling lists with certain alternating color order. Coding grids was a bit more confusing and still kind of is to me, but  grids were used to format things properly on different screens. 
 The colors I chose was a dark purple and blue and very light purple/pink. I tried making the entire site standout with dark and bright colors so it can grab the users attention.
